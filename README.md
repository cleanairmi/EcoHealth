# EcoHealth

EcoHealth is a mobile app; It represents my deep passion to spread awareness about clean air and healthy living all across US. 

EcoHealth serves as a tool that inspires youth like me to make choices that improve both our health and the environment.

The app has three main features: **Clean Air**, **Healthy Living**, **Awareness** - each playing a crucial role in my mission to promote the well-being.

**Clean Air** - This category encourages users to participate in various fun, healthy and eco-friendly challenges.
**Healthy Living** - This category is about fostering a commitment to a more sustainable life.
**Awareness** -  is a bridge from knowledge to action.
